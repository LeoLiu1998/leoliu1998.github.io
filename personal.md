# Bios
I was born in Zhanjiang, China. Due to my father's job, I moved to many places during my childhood. Finally, we settle at Shenzhen, China -- a very energetic city! Back then, I was very not good at my words, but I experienced a great personality change during my precious time at <a href="https://www.alevel.com.cn/" target="_blank">Shenzhen College of International Education</a>

It was during my summer school at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Berkeley</a> when I programed a Scheme Interpreter that I got interested about the idea of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

# Misc
I love Chinese Calligraphy, escpecially running hand!\\
I love traveling, playing games with my friends, although those are rare occasions. :(
